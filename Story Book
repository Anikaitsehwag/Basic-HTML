<h2>Tenali Raman And Two Thives</h2>
<p>One summer night, when Tenali Raman and his wife were about to sleep, he heard a rustling sound of leaves coming from outside.
There was not even a slightest breeze blowing at the time, so he presumed that there were some thieves hiding in the bushes. He figured that they must be planning to rob his house in the night.

He thought of a plan and said to his wife, “My dear, I have heard that some notorious thieves are on the loose in our neighborhood. So, let’s hide all the jewellery and money that we have in the well.

A little later, Tenali Raman and his wife came out of the house carrying a big trunk, and dropped it into the well. Then they went back inside the house, and pretended to be asleep.

The thieves waited for a while and then started drawing water from the well.

They hoped to empty the well and get the treasure. The thieves kept drawing out water the entire night. Towards daybreak, they managed to pull out the trunk, and when they opened it, they were extremely shocked and disappointed to see only some big stones in it.

They understood that it was Tenali Raman’s plan to outsmart them. Just then, Tenali Raman came out of his house and said, “Thank you friends, for watering my plants. I must pay you for your labour.”

Hearing this, the thieves fell at Tenali’s feet for forgiveness. They promised not to steal or rob anyone ever again. Tenali decides to let them go.

Moral- Keeping cool and using your wit in dire situations can help you get out of them.

<h2>A Lesson to the Greedy Brahmins</h2>
<p>
There is another great story about the wisdom of Tenali Raman.

The King, Krishnadevaraya’s mother was a very pious and orthodox lady. She had visited all holy places and given much of her treasures in charity to temples. Once she showed the desire of giving away fruits in charity and her son, the king, obliged.

Krishnadevaraya immediately got many mangoes from Ratnagiri. He respected his mother a lot and never let her down. Unfortunately, before the auspicious day could arrive, his mother died.

Krishnadevaraya followed all religious rites. They went on for many days. On the last day, the King called some Brahmins and said, ‘my mother’s last wish was to offer mangoes to Brahmins. But she could not fulfil this wish and died. What can I do so that my mother’s last wish could be fulfilled and she can rest in peace?’

The Brahmins were greedy. They said that only if the King would give each Brahmin a gold mango, would his mother be able to rest in peace.
Krishnadevarya on hearing this immediately ordered some gold mangoes to be made and presented them to the Brahmins, thinking now his mother would be happy and peaceful.

Tenali Raman heard about this and he called those Brahmins to his home to perform the last rite ceremonies of his own mother.

When the Brahmins came to Tenali’s house Tenali closed all the doors and windows and stood in front of them with a red hot iron rod. The Brahmins were taken aback but Tenali removed their confusion.

‘My mother had knee pains and as a remedy she wanted me to cure her with these hot iron rods. But she died before I could help her. So now I want to fulfil her wish by giving you all this treatment’, Tenali said to the Brahmins.

The Brahmins were shocked and said that it is injustice on them and that they will not be a part of it.

But Tenali said that since they had taken the golden mangoes from the king because that way it could provide peace to his dead mother, this was the way Tenali’s mother could find peace.

The greedy Brahmins understood that they have not done right and they returned the mangoes to the King.

Later Tenali Raman told king Krishnadevarya that the treasure of the palace should not be exploited by giving them to such greedy people. Instead, it should be put to feed and serve the needy.</P>

<h2> Tenali Raman and The Arab Horse Trader</h2>
<p>

Once, an Arab horse trader came to Krishan Deva Raya’s court.

He said, “Your Majesty, see this Arab steed! It is my finest. If you like, I can get more.”

Krishna Deva Raya replied thoughtfully, “This is the only breed missing from my stable.”

The king saw the beautiful horses standing outside his palace.

Krishna Deva Raya said impulsively, “I will buy them all!”

The trader replied, “I need an advance of 5000 gold coins. I’ll bring them in two days.”

Two weeks passed.

Krishna Deva Raya thought to himself while walking in his garden, “Where is the trader?” He saw Tenali Raman sitting there, writing on a piece of paper.

Krishna Deva Raya asked, “What are you writing, Tenali Raman?”

Tenali Raman replied, “I’m listing the biggest fools in the land.”

Curious, Krishna Deva Raya said, “Let me have a look.” Tenali Raman handed him the paper.

Krishna Deva Raya was taken aback and angry. “How can my name be at the top of this list? I’m the king!”

Tenali Raman retorted, “Whoever gives a stranger 5000 gold coins and thinks that he will return is a fool, Your Majesty.”

Krishna Deva Raya asked, “What if he returns?”

Tenali Raman replied in an instant, “Then I will put his name at the top of the list instead of yours!”

Krishna Deva Raya said, “I understand what you’re saying, Tenali. I will always consult you now on important matters.”

<h2>Tenali Raman in the Delhi Durbar</H2>
<P>
When Krishna Deva Raya used to rule in Vijaynagar, Babur ruled Delhi. Babur wanted to meet Tenali Raman asa he had heard a great deal about Tenali’s quick wit.

Babur’s messenger arrived in Krishna Deva Raya’s court one day. He said, “Greetings, King Krishna Deva Raya. Emperor Babur wishes Tenali Raman would visit Delhi.”
Krishna Deva Raya replied, “So be it.”

Tenali Raman reached Delhi and settled in the guesthouse.
Meanwhile, Babur spoke with his courtiers in court. He had a plan. “No one will laugh at Tenali Raman’s jokes tomorrow! I want to see how he will make us laugh then.”
The courtiers chorused, “Yes, Your Majesty.”

The next day, Tenali Raman arrived in the court.
Tenali Raman started to narrate one of his jokes. “Once there was a …”
The courtiers cut him off by yawning profusely.

On the sixteenth day, Tenali Raman stopped going to the court.
Tenali Raman thought to himself, “Let me follow Babur to see where he goes everyday.” He wore such clothes that no one wold be able to see his face.

Babur and his minister would walk by the Yamuna every morning.
Babur said, while giving gold coins to beggars, “There you go! Make good use of them.”

Tenali Raman thought of a plan.

The next day, Tenali Raman disguised himself as an old man. He also had a spade and mango sapling.

Tenali Raman thought, “Let me wait for the king here.”
Seeing the king approach,, Tenali began planting the sapling.
Babar said, “You’re old, you won’t be alive when this tree bears fruit. Why are you planting it?”

Tenali Raman said, “Your Majesty, I tasted the fruits of trees my forefathers planted. Similarly, my grandchildren will enjoy the fruit of this tree.”
Babar exclaimed, “That is a noble thought!”

Wanting to reward the old man, Babar took a bag and and said, “Here, take this bag of gold coins.”
Tenali Raman replied, “Thank you, Your Majesty. You have given me the fruit of planting this sapling before it has grown.”

Babar, pleased with this answer too, said, “Well done, again. Take this second bag of gold coins.”
Tenali Raman said, “A tree gives fruit once a year, but I am getting the fruit of my labour twice, Your Majesty!”

Babar again appreciated this clever reply. He said, “Bravo! This third bag of gold coins is also yours.”
Babur’s minister whispered to him, “Your Majesty, at this rate you will give all your wealth to him. Let’s go.”

Babar, laughing, agreed.
Tenali Raman took off his fake beard and called out to them as they were going, “Your Majesty, please look at me.”

Babar was astounded at Tenali Raman’s intelligence. He said, “Tenali Raman, you are truly a great wit! Come back to court for more rewards.”

Tenali Raman went back to Babar’s court and entertained him for many days. Finally, he returned home.
Krishna Deva Raya said, “You have brought glory to the kingdom, Tenali!”
Tenali Raman flashed back, “Your Majesty, then I deserve a reward from you too!”

Krishna Deva Raya said, laughing, “Yes, indeed. Here are 10,000 gold coins.”
Tenali Raman replied, “Thank you, Your Majesty!

<H2> Tenali Raman and the Red Peacock</h2>
<p>

Krishna Deva Raya’s greedy minister, Chatur Pandit, arrives at the court with a red peacock.
Krishna Deva Raya: I have never seen such a creature!

Courtiers: We agree!

Chatur Pandit: Please accept this gift, Your Majesty! My servants searched the jungles of Madhya Pradesh to find this creature.

Tenali Raman (thinks): How can a bird so bright survive in the jungle? Other animals will easily be able to see it and kill it.

Krishan Deva Raya: Thank you, Chatur Pandit! How can we reward you?

Chatur Pandit: Your Majesty, a 100 gold coins will be enough, as I spent that to get the bird.

Tenali Raman: Your Majesty, I think we should observe this peacock for a while before we give Chatur Pandit his reward. I will go to Madhya Pradesh to get more birds like these.

Krishna Deva Raya: Alright, Tenali. You have 2 weeks.

Tenali Raman did not go to Madhya Pradesh.

Tenali (to his spies): Look for the person who has painted that peacock red.

Spies: Yes, sir!

The spies found the painter.

Tenali (to the painter): Don’t worry, I won’t punish you. Just paint another 10 peacocks the same colour.

Painter: Ji, huzoor.

Tenali Raman takes the peacocks to the court, two weeks later.

Krishna Deva Raya: Bravo, Tenali. Treasurer, give him a 1000 gold coins.

Tenali Raman: That is not what they cost, Your Majesty.

Krishna Deva Raya: What is your price then, Tenali Raman?

Tenali Raman: A bucket of water, a bag of red paint, and a gold coin for this artist.

Krishna Deva Raya (angrily): Chatur Pandit, I sentence you to…

Tenali Raman: Your Majesty, your desire for fame led you to believe a red peacock could exist. For a long time, there has been needless spending on such curiosities.

Tenali Raman: It is better that your subjects be prosperous, rather than a display of wealth. I request you to let Chatur Pandit go and reward the artist for highlighting this matter.

Krishna Deva Raya: You’re right, Tenali.

Chatur Pandit (falls at the king’s feet): Your Majesty, please forgive me.

Krishna Deva Raya: I will do so, but you are banished from the court for a month. And you must return the gifts you got earlier.

The monsoon arrived and the peacocks danced. The rain washed off their red colour.

Krishna Deva Raya (laughs): Look, Tenali!

Tenali smiles.

The people of the kingdom danced in the rain.

The people (to each other): We are lucky to have a king who is not afraid to admit his mistake.

Chatur Pandit walked home alone in the rain.</p>
